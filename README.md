### Numbers about companies are scattered everywhere. Official reports are here, stock prices there, each in a different structure. Consequently, anyone who wants to understand a company’s performance, whether they are learning or investing, usually has to gather figures themselves and organize them before spotting patterns. Our project tackles this problem by pulling current financial details directly from official resources, linking those figures to how the stock moves each day, then displaying it all in clear, usable charts. You can choose a business, check its recent track record, get insights from its statistics, and build a starter investment plan that matches your comfort level.

### The first instrument is the Individual Company Performance Lookup tool. We begin with the SEC’s official EDGAR data, then link stock tickers to the unique CIK IDs that EDGAR uses. With that link in place, we download each company’s facts file, which is coded with XBRL tags. Revenue is the main figure we track. Companies report revenue in different ways, so we check the three common tags and pick whichever has the freshest date. After that, we align the data in two views. One shows results every three months. We compute this by comparing reports within the same year to turn year-to-date values into true quarterly numbers. The other is an annual view where we keep one number per fiscal year, typically from a 10-K if it is available. This gives consistent comparisons based on the latest information.

### We track earnings alongside a few vital items, like profit, what the company owns, what it owes, stockholders’ equity, cash, operating cash flow, current assets, current liabilities, and diluted earnings per share. From these we compute a few simple ratios. We show the ability to cover short-term debts, the level of leverage, and basic profitability. When there is enough history, at least two annual points, we also calculate year over year revenue growth. All numbers are formatted cleanly so they are quick to read.

### We pull key sentences from recent company filings, focusing on the section where management discusses performance. We identify that section with pattern searches, then score sentences with a small list of finance terms such as growth, margin, guidance, cost, demand, and liquidity. It mirrors how leaders describe their results and priorities. It is not a deep dive, but it does give a fast sense of what the company emphasizes.

### Our system suggests buy, hold, or sell with simple rules tied to core data. It looks at revenue growth compared to last year, net margin, and debt relative to equity. A Buy appears when growth is healthy, margins are positive, and debt looks reasonable. A Sell appears when growth stalls or turns negative, margins go negative, or debt looks stretched. All other cases default to Hold. This is not investment advice. It is a transparent rule set that connects a few important numbers to a plain decision that you can verify.

### You can explore the layout easily. There are two revenue charts, one quarterly and one annual, each with a simple date control. There is also a daily price chart with the same style of control. You can zoom in on the latest period or pull back to see longer patterns. The notebook keeps the interaction simple so the charts update without extra steps.

### To match different comfort levels with risk, we built a portfolio maker. It starts with a broad set of well known and liquid US stocks. From daily prices it estimates average returns and volatility, then blends three ideas. Equal weight spreads exposure, inverse volatility leans toward steadier names, and a mean variance sleeve tilts toward return. Your risk setting controls the blend. If you are willing to chase return, the mix leans that way. If you want stability, the mix pulls toward calmer names. A cap keeps any single position from getting too large. The output includes a weights bar chart, a risk versus return scatter where bubble size shows weight, and a growth of one dollar curve, plus summary stats like CAGR, volatility, Sharpe, and max drawdown.

### To push the analysis forward, we added a straightforward revenue forecast. We fit a simple line to past revenue over time and use that to project the next point. This uses an ordinary least squares fit and reports a 95 percent confidence band around the fitted line. It also gives a 95 percent prediction interval for the next period, which is wider because it accounts for noise in new observations. The chart shows where revenue has been, how the fitted line tracks that history, the range of likely values, and a point forecast for what may come next. This helps you see trend, risk, and uncertainty in one place.

### This approach works well in practice. It combines official documents with market prices, so the process is repeatable. It prefers the freshest revenue tags, so it reflects current reporting. It turns annual totals into clean quarterly values for better comparisons. It also condenses long filings into bite-size notes. The portfolio tool translates your risk preference into exact weights and shows results with standard measures. The forecast adds a view of what might happen next and how confident we can be.

### We know there are limits. The rating rules are fixed and do not adjust for industry quirks or broad economic shifts. The revenue forecast uses time alone, not drivers like price, volume, or macro data. The portfolio backtest ignores dividends, fees, and taxes, and it assumes simple daily rebalancing for clarity. Price data can miss certain names or events, and any fixed universe can lean optimistic. The filing parser depends on common layouts and can miss cases when formats change. These tradeoffs keep the tool simple and explainable, but they also show where to improve.

### There is a direct path to the next version. Add more fundamentals such as margin and cash flow to the rating rules. Let the forecast handle seasonality or run updates as new data arrives. Include dividends and costs in the portfolio and consider monthly or quarterly rebalancing. Manage sector totals to limit concentration. Add a basic tone counter for positive and negative language in filings. Save intermediate results and add basic checks to improve speed and reliability.
The project ties many pieces together to tell a live story about a business and its stock. It adjusts revenue so comparisons are fair. It gathers key stats alongside short management notes. It links simple rules to plain decisions. It lets you set your risk level and see a diversified portfolio with clear results. It also offers a modest forecast with uncertainty marked out. The result is a usable, understandable tool that is ready to grow.
