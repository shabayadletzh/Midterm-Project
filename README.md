Numbers about companies are scattered everywhere. Official reports are here, stock prices there - each in a different structure. Consequently, anyone attempting to understand a company’s performance, where they are learning or investing, typically must gather figures themselves and organize them before spotting patterns. Our project tackles this challenge: gathering current financial details directly from official resources, linking those figures to how the stock is doing each day, then displaying it all in clear, usable charts. You can choose a business, check its recent track record, get insights from their statistics, and create a starter investment plan suited to your comfort level.

In practice, the API we choose follows a simple path so the latest numbers stay front and center. It looks up the company’s CIK using the official ticker file, requests the facts file from EDGAR, and lines up a clean timeline for revenue so recent periods appear first. The goal is not to chase every possible field, but to make the core items easy to read and compare.

The first instrument we have created is the Individual Company Performance Lookup tool, where we first tap into the SEC’s official data sources. Then, linking stock tickers to unique IDs, we grab each company’s data file that contains information coded using XBRL standards. Revenue takes center stage within these files as the main statistic we are looking into. Companies income differently, therefore we select the newest from the three usual methods. Following that, we align data using a couple of perspectives. One shows results each three month - we figure this out by comparing reports within a single year. Each year, a single figure is selected from financial reports - typically a 10-K if there is one. It’s important because this ensures consistent comparisons based on the latest data.

We track earnings alongside a few vital figures – like profit, what the company owns, debts, owner investment, available funds, money from daily business, short-term possessions, immediate obligations, moreover earnings per share. Using those, we calculate straightforward comparisons: ability to cover short-term debts, leverage, likewise profitability. When there’s enough data - at least two years’ worth - we figure out how much yearly income has changed. 

Our system suggests whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock - a straightforward call rooted in clear criteria. It looks at how much revenue increased from last year, profitability, alongside company debt versus its value. A Buy rating appears when expansion thrives alongside healthy profits, yet debt remains sensible. Should expansion falter, or profits dip - or if debts balloon - a Sell rating applies. In all remaining cases, Hold. Don’t take this as guidance on where to put your money. Instead, think of it as a straightforward system linking core data points to choices - one you can readily check over. We also decided to implement our own interpretation of a stock analyst since we found many of the APIs having very subjective data and wanted to challenge ourselves a bit more. 

You can easily poke around the design. It features two ways to look at income - one for each three months, another for the whole year - with a tool to pick dates. A similar date picker accompanies a graph displaying prices day by day. You can zoom in on what’s new, or pull back to observe broader patterns. This notebook doesn’t require any tricky coding; instead, controls adjust the chart display directly – a simple approach that makes updates straightforward.

To match how comfortable people are with risk, we crafted a portfolio maker. It begins by looking at lots of well-known, easily traded American company shares. From everyday numbers, it figures out likely gains alongside potential downsides, then combines three distinct strategies. One seeks better rewards for each bit of risk taken; another smooths things out by favoring calmer investments; still another spreads bets widely for balance. How these combine hinges on how much risk you’re willing to accept. If someone prefers bigger gains, we shift investments there. Those wanting safety get more stable options. To keep things balanced, we limit how much goes into any one investment then adjust accordingly. It shows how a dollar grows, alongside risk measures like yearly swings, reward per unit of risk, then biggest losses. You can play with graphs to see exactly how well investments did over different periods.

A short note on why portfolio weights can move between runs helps set expectations. The set of dates we keep depends on shared coverage across names and the most recent trading day in the data. When that window shifts by even a little, the covariance and averages shift as well, which nudges the blend of equal weight, inverse volatility, and mean variance. The rule caps still hold, and the same settings still drive the shape of the answer, but the final numbers reflect the latest history that survived the quorum filter.

To really get somewhere with this work, we’re adding a straightforward way to forecast income. Essentially, we draw the line of the best fit through past earnings data - using just time as a guide - so we can see where things might head. This relies on standard statistical methods. It’s deliberately compact, designed to directly address queries. For instance, assuming things keep going as they have been - considering how much money came in lately - what revenue should we anticipate during the subsequent timeframe? This program figures out the line that fits data most closely. It also shows a zone of reasonable certainty around this line, based on past information - a 95% confidence band. Furthermore, it forecasts where the next piece of data will probably fall, giving a 95% prediction interval. This forecast range is broader since it accounts for unpredictable variation alongside the general trend. You can see where income has been, how well a line fits that history, a range showing possible outcomes, then what might happen going forward - complete with its own wiggle room. It helps folks grasp patterns alongside potential risks, making conversations simpler.

We believe that our project makes the convenient method to track the financial data. Because it combines documents alongside costs, anyone can do it again. Because data tags prioritize newness, it reflects current income. Moreover, it transforms yearly totals into accurate quarterly views for clearer graphs. Consequently, key details from lengthy reports become quickly accessible. It translates how comfortable you are with risk into exact investment amounts, then displays outcomes using straightforward measurements. Moreover, it includes predictions alongside a range of possibilities, letting you grasp both likely scenarios and potential surprises.

We understand there are boundaries. This suggestion tool operates by fixed guidelines, so it doesn’t consider variations among industries, how companies make money, or broader economic factors. Revenue prediction relies on a single factor; things such as pricing, volume, or economic trends aren’t considered. Portfolio testing leaves out dividends, charges, alongside tax implications - it also resets every day to keep it straightforward. Data regarding prices might miss certain stocks or company changes, additionally there’s potential for an optimistic slant within the chosen group of investments. Pulling data from those lengthy reports relies on spotting familiar layouts; sometimes things get overlooked when the format changes. This approach helps us stay on track while ensuring results we can verify, yet it also suggests areas needing further attention.

Drawing from our previous finance knowledge from classes such as Portfolio Management and Equity Valuation, to further improve the project we may suggest some extra steps which involve adding a few more measurable elements such as profit margin and cash flow, then connecting them to the suggestion tool. Revenue forecasts could also improve through patterns seen across seasons or by running updated regressions whenever new data arrives. Portfolio tests might include dividends and expenses while adjusting on a monthly or quarterly basis. We can also limit how much of each sector appears in the portfolio to balance exposure. When it comes to interpreting written reports, we might compare how often positive and negative financial terms appear. Finally, keeping temporary storage for results and automatic checks for key data points would make updates faster and more reliable.

Altogether, the project brings separate pieces of financial information into a single, organized view. It adjusts income figures to make yearly and quarterly results comparable, summarizes leadership insights, and links those findings with straightforward indicators. By combining these parts, it helps users understand where a company stands, how it performs over time, and how different investment levels might behave. With added forecasting, it also shows what may come next and how confident we can be in that view. The result is a clear, practical system that presents complex company data in a way that anyone can explore and build upon.
